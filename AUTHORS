This library is influenced by the original Ruby osc library by Tadayoshi Funaba
<tadf@funaba.org> which can be found at http://www.funaba.org/en/ruby.html#osc

Hans Fugal <hans@fugal.net> heavily refactored, rewritten, and to some extent
redesigned that code to produce what you have here.

Thanks to Paul Battley for the ingenious Tiger pack hack.
